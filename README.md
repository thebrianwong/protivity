# Protivity

A productivity mobile app created to prevent myself from excessively scrolling through Reddit
during exercise rest periods.

Set the desired duration of your rest periods.

While the timer is counting down, read a random fun fact generated by Google Gemini AI instead of
getting distracted by something else on the phone.

When the timer expires, the fun fact is erased. Since there's nothing to read, it's time to
move on to your next exercise set!

Adjust settings to turn on/off the alarm, vibration, and fun fact deletion.
